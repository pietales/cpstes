**This is my custom cps test** <br />
**I wrote this in java swing which I am still getting used to so don't bully me** <br />
*_my action listeners are formated as follows_*

`buttonname.addActionListener(new ActionListenser() {`
    <br />  `@Override`
    <br /> `public void ActionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {`
    <br /> <br /> `}` <br />
`}`
<br />
*_instead of creating a class for the event and creating a new_* <br />
*_instance everytime_*
